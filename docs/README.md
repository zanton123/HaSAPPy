#HaSAPPy (Haploid Screening Analysis Package in Python)



##INTRODUCTION

Forward genetic screens are becoming increasingly useful as approaches to unveil the complexity of cellular mechanisms. Recent introduction of mammalian haploid cells opened the possibility to perform forward genetic screens using insertional mutagenesis in mammals. Haploid cells have originally been obtained from human tumors and subsequently have been established from haploid embryos of several mammals.

Mutagenesis of haploid cells leads to hemizygous mutantions which ensures phenotypic exposure. This is in contrast to diploid cells, where in general two copies of each chromosome are present, and effects of mutations in specific genes can be masked by the functional copy on the second chromosome.

For screening viral gene trap vectors are commonly used as mutagens for their large mutational effect and utility for providing a sequence tag for the genomic insertion site. Large haploid mutant pools are established by viral transduction following by selection of a phenotype of interest. Subsequent identification of viral insertions that become enriched after selection can define gene mutations and pathways that contribute to the phenotype under investigation. Readout of many thousands of insertion sites has become possible by deep sequencing of DNA extracted from large cell pools using specialized Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) protocols.

HaSAPPy performs analysis of NGS datasets form pooled haploid mammalian cell screens and is used to identify insertion locations in the whole genome, map them at the level of genes, and classify insertions according to their effects on gene function. Customizable output of all calculated parameters and ranking of candidate genes is performed. The implementation conforms to current Python programming guidelines and is open to be adapted and extended according to experimental setup. The data processing and analysis is performed by the following modules:

**Modules:**
 - Read trimming of adaptor and low quality sequences in **Trim.py** (requires Preprocess reads)
 - Read alignment to PhiX control and reference genomes in **Align.py** (bowtie2, NextGenMap, or nvBowtie are required)
 - Identification of Independent Insertions (I.I.) in **IIDefinition.py**
 - Counting insertions at the genes level in **GenesDefinition.py**
 - Enrichment analysis in **GroupAnalysis.py**
 - Data presentation **Tables.py** and **DesignGeneInsertions.py**

**Output**
Output of the program is written in standard .xlsx and .svg file formats and can be customized in a command script.


##PREREQUISITES

For the correct functionality of HaSAPPy program the following Python Packages are necessary and requested to download/update using the `pip -install` or `pip install --upgrade` command:
 - numpy
 - HTSeq
 - matplotlib
 - pandas
 - scipy
 - sklearn
 - xlsxwriter
 
For using the alignment module requires NGS readmappers are required and should be in the PATH:
- Bowtie2: to remove Phix sequences from libraries
- Bowtie2, nvBowtie and Nextgenemap: to align libraries against a reference genome

Instructions how to install these read mappers can be found at:

| Program     | Source                                                |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------|
| Bowtie2     | http://bowtie-bio.sourceforge.net/bowtie2/index.shtml |
| nvBowtie    | http://nvlabs.github.io/nvbio/                        |
| Nextgenemap | http://cibiv.github.io/NextGenMap/                    |

Fasta files for the PhiX and reference genomes can be obtained from the Illumina browser, for use with HaSAPPy select UCSC as the source:

http://support.illumina.com/sequencing/sequencing_software/igenome.html). 


##INSTALLATION

To use HaSAPPy program download the package from GitHub repository. If you have git installed you can use the following command:
```
cd
git clone https://github.com/gdiminin/HaSAPPy.git
```
This will install all Python files in the 'HaSAPPy/program' folder under your home folder. For read preprocessing a precompiled executable PreprocessReads is supplied. This is an optional step in data processing and if desired requires to set the execute property on this file:
```
cd
chmod +x PreprocessReads
```

This step is not required if adaptor and quality trimming of the reads is not desired.


##GENERATE THE GENE ANNOTATION REFERENCE FOR HaSAPPy SOFTWARE

After installation of HaSAPPY program, Genes Annotation Reference must be generated using GeneReference_built.py
The program requires two variables:

`python GeneReference_built.py -i <path-to-input-file.txt> -o <path-to-output-anotation.pkl>`

**-i** (INPUT) 	location of .txt file containing gene annotations according to UCSC browser. In the download folder, users can find the mm10_REFSEQgenes.txt file built for the mouse genome according to the assembly of Dec. 2011 (GCRm38/mm10). Alternatively, annotations can be obtained from UCSC browser (http://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgTables?command=start). Provide the following informations:	

| Task | Selection |
| --- | --- |
| *clade*	| Mammal |
| *genome* | Mouse or Human |
| *assembly* | (according to the last version) |
| *group*	| Genes and Gene Predictions |
| *track*	| RefSeq Genes |
| *table*	| refGene |
| *region* | genome |
| *output format*	| all fields from selected table |
| *output file* |	… |
| *file type returned* | gzip compressed |

**-o** (OUTPUT)	location where to store pandas library containing gene annotations necessary for HaSAPPy program. Informations are stored in a .pkl file. Add .pkl extension to the PATH provided

Ex.
```
User$ python GeneReference_built.py -i User/HaSAPPy/Doc/mm10_REFSEQgenes.txt -o User/HaSAPPy/mm10_HaSAPPY_refernce.pkl
```

Write output PATH in LoadModule.txt where requested (see next)


##RUN HaSAPPy SOFTWARE

Compile LoadModule.txt file according to instructions and save the modified file (Don’t overwrite it). Run the program using HaSAPPy_start.py file. The program requests as parameter the location of LoadModule file.

Ex.
```
User$ python HaSAPPY_start.py User/HaSAPPy/Commands/LoadModule_170101.txt
```
